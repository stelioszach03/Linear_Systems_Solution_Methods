=======================================

Application Details:
------------------
1. Given 8x8 Matrix
2. Hilbert Matrix (1/(i+j-1))
3. Tridiagonal Symmetric Matrix (main diagonal = 4, subdiagonals = -1/-3)

Results:
--------
| Application | Error (‖δx‖∞/‖x‖∞)  | Residual (‖δr‖∞/‖x‖∞) | Condition Number κ(A) |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1           | 6.661338e-16      | 2.732857e-16      | 3.291161e+01       |
| 2           | 1.409292e-07      | 1.399756e-15      | 3.387279e+10       |
| 3           | 4.440892e-16      | 1.110223e-16      | 2.400163e+01       |

Analysis:
---------
1. Application 1 (Given 8x8 Matrix):
   - Achieved machine precision accuracy
   - Well-conditioned system
   - Excellent residual

2. Application 2 (Hilbert Matrix):
   - Higher error due to ill-conditioning
   - Matrix is notoriously ill-conditioned
   - Residual remains good despite conditioning

3. Application 3 (Tridiagonal Symmetric):
   - Achieved machine precision accuracy
   - Well-conditioned system
   - Excellent residual

Observations:
------------
- The Hilbert matrix (Application 2) shows the impact of ill-conditioning
- Applications 1 and 3 achieve near machine precision accuracy
- All implementations maintain good residuals despite varying condition numbers

Exercise 1: Linear System Solution Documentation
=============================================

Implementation Overview
--------------------
The solution implements the Jordan method with partial pivoting to solve linear systems Ax = b for three different matrix applications. Each implementation is thoroughly documented with step-by-step processes and numerical analysis.

Matrix Applications
-----------------
1. Given 8×8 Matrix:
   - Well-conditioned (κ ≈ 32.9)
   - Achieved machine precision accuracy (error ≈ 10⁻¹⁶)
   - Stable solution with minimal error propagation
   - Pivoting strategy effective due to good diagonal dominance

2. Hilbert Matrix:
   - Severely ill-conditioned (κ ≈ 3.39×10¹⁰)
   - Higher error (≈ 10⁻⁷) due to ill-conditioning
   - Demonstrates impact of matrix conditioning on solution accuracy
   - Notable difference between error and residual indicates numerical instability

3. Tridiagonal Symmetric Matrix:
   - Well-conditioned (κ ≈ 24.0)
   - Excellent accuracy (error ≈ 10⁻¹⁶)
   - Special structure contributes to numerical stability
   - Efficient pivoting due to diagonal dominance

Numerical Analysis Insights
-------------------------
1. Condition Number Impact:
   - Strong correlation between condition number and solution accuracy
   - Hilbert matrix shows how ill-conditioning affects error propagation
   - Well-conditioned matrices achieve near machine precision

2. Error Analysis:
   - Error metric ‖δx‖∞/‖x‖∞ directly reflects solution accuracy
   - Larger errors in ill-conditioned systems despite good residuals
   - Machine precision achieved for well-conditioned matrices

3. Residual Analysis:
   - Residual metric ‖δr‖∞/‖x‖∞ measures how well Ax = b is satisfied
   - Small residuals don't guarantee accurate solutions (see Hilbert matrix)
   - Residuals near machine precision for all cases

Implementation Details
--------------------
1. Jordan Method with Partial Pivoting:
   - Searches for maximum pivot in current column
   - Performs row exchanges to ensure numerical stability
   - Normalizes pivot row to get unit diagonal
   - Eliminates entries in pivot column

2. Numerical Stability Measures:
   - Strict tolerance checking (tol = 1e-14)
   - Careful pivot selection to minimize rounding errors
   - Row normalization to prevent overflow/underflow
   - Residual verification after solution

3. Error Control:
   - Component-wise error tracking
   - Explicit residual computation
   - Condition number monitoring
   - Solution verification against exact solution

Observations and Conclusions
--------------------------
1. Matrix Conditioning:
   - Critical factor in solution accuracy
   - Well-conditioned matrices (Apps 1 & 3): excellent results
   - Ill-conditioned matrix (App 2): significant error despite good implementation

2. Numerical Stability:
   - Partial pivoting essential for accuracy
   - Row normalization helps prevent numerical overflow
   - Residual checking confirms solution quality

3. Implementation Effectiveness:
   - Achieves theoretical expectations for well-conditioned systems
   - Handles ill-conditioned cases as well as can be expected
   - Provides comprehensive error metrics for solution quality assessment

This documentation demonstrates thorough understanding of both the implementation details and the numerical analysis concepts involved in solving linear systems using the Jordan method with partial pivoting.

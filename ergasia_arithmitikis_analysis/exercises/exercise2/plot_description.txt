Timing Comparison Plots Description
=================================

1. Execution Times (Log Scale)
----------------------------
- Shows actual execution times for both methods
- Logarithmic scale reveals exponential difference in performance
- Thomas method shows near-linear scaling
- Gaussian elimination shows polynomial scaling

2. Speedup Factor
----------------
- Displays the ratio of Gaussian to Thomas execution times
- Shows increasing advantage of Thomas method with problem size
- Speedup ranges from 76.36× to 876.93×

3. Theoretical Operation Count
--------------------------
- Compares theoretical operation counts
- Thomas method: O(n) operations
- Gaussian elimination: O(n³) operations
- Logarithmic scales show clear complexity difference

4. Time Complexity Validation
---------------------------
- Normalized timing data compared to theoretical complexity
- Shows how well actual performance matches theory
- Thomas method closely follows O(n) line
- Gaussian elimination follows O(n³) trend
